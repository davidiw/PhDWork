\chapter{Conclusions}
In this proposal, I have explained the construction of scalable, decentralized
VPNs.  To support this work, I have designed and implement features to
structured overlays improving their usability.  Relays enable two-hop
connections between peers that cannot form direct connections.  Private
virtual overlays provide a secure overlay and secure the VPN.  Group
environments make the creation of VPNs significantly easier.  In addition, I
designed and implemented a VPN architecture that supports both Interface and
Router configurations combining the attractive features of each into a Hybrid
approach.
