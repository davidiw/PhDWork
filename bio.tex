David Isaac Wolinsky was born on October 31, 1982.  He has been married to Donna
Korin Wolinsky since June 2007 and was blessed with a son, Isaac Emmanuel, on
November 30, 2009.  He began his studies at the
University of Florida in August 2001, obtained a bachelors of science degree
in the spring of 2005 and a masters of science degree in the spring of 2007, and
am currently pursuing a doctorate of philosophy.  My advisor is Professor Renato
Figueiredo, whom I have had the pleasure of working with since the spring of 2006
at the Advanced Computing and Informatoin Systems Lab.

My primary research focuses are network virtualization using structured P2P
overlays.  This research work has been realized in IPOP, a free (GPL) network
virtualization software.  I have worked on enabling DHTs, decentralized NAT
traversal through relays, software models for improved network virtualization,
and autonomic virtual networking stacks.  This work is a major contribution to
my other research focus, Grid Appliance, which enables the creation of
decentralized, distributed grids through virtualized, physical, and cloud
resources.

During my free time, I enjoy time with my boy (son), running, playing
basketball with the LBBA (Larsen-Benton Basketball Association) colleagues, and
occassionally playing video games.  At one point prior to engaging in the arts
of seeking a Ph.D., I was ranked in the top 20 on the US East Warcraft III Free
For All Ladder.  Most of my time is split between the Archer project and
attempting to finish my Ph.D. prior to turning 30, thankfully I have a few years
prior to turning 30.  During my deeper moments, I contemplate my struggle with
the amazing gift that Christ as my savior gave to me in spite of my brokeness.
